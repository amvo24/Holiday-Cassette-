# Code Wranglers Holiday Cassette Player Documentation

Firstly, we want to express our gratitude to Sonny and the entire Codedex team for this fantastic opportunity. The Code Wranglers team, consisting of Kris (@yeupi), Andrew (@cloud.8510), and Mark (@meatloaf93), developed an interactive cassette player to bring holiday joy!

## Purpose and Features

Our interactive cassette player allows users to enjoy a festive playlist with features such as play, pause, skip, and previous track navigation. Notably, unpausing resumes playback where you left off!

## Installation

To get started:
1. Ensure you have the latest version of Flask installed. (pip or pip3 install Flask).
2. Run `app.py` inside the 'my_flask_app' directory.
3. View the local server port in your terminal.

## Directory Structure

If you're curious about the project structure, key files are located in specific directories. For example:
- `static`: Contains static assets (CSS, images, audio files).
- `templates`: Holds HTML templates for Flask.

## Dependencies

Apart from Flask, make sure you have all necessary dependencies installed before running the application.

Thank you for exploring our holiday cassette player, and we hope it adds a touch of festivity to your celebrations!
